/** The authenticator assurance level can be one of \&quot;aal1\&quot;, \&quot;aal2\&quot;, or \&quot;aal3\&quot;. A higher number means that it is harder for an attacker to compromise the account.  Generally, \&quot;aal1\&quot; implies that one authentication factor was used while AAL2 implies that two factors (e.g. password + TOTP) have been used.
